### FLASK 
- Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. 
- It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
- It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
- However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. ```

### Installing flask

Paste this command in the terminal to get flask in your system

```pip install -U Flask```

### What is Flask used for?

## Flask is a lightweight Web Server Gateway Interface WSGI web application framework that was created to make getting started easy and making it easy for new beginners.
## With the tendency to scale up to complex applications.

## Flask has its foundation around Werkzeug and Jinja2 and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

## As a developer in developing a web app in python, you may be using a framework to your advantage. A framework is a code storage that should help developers achieve the required    result by making work easier, scalable, efficient and maintainable web applications by providing reusable code or extensions for common operations.

## These frameworks for Python comes in different ways, owned and created by different people. Examples are; Flask, Tornado, Django, e.t.c.


### Why Flask

## Flask gives the developer varieties of choice when developing web applications, it provides you with tools, libraries, and mechanics that allow you to build a web application but it will not enforce any dependencies or tell you how the project should look like.
## The web application can be a blog, commercial website or some web pages, it still allow the developers the opportunity to use some extensions provided by the community that allows you to add more functionality to the web application.


### Pros and cons

## Some of the good things that come with using flask as your framework to develop the web application is little dependency to update and be on the lookout for security bugs.

## While a disadvantage of using flask is that sometimes you end up doing more work for yourself or increase the list of dependencies by yourself by adding extension.
## Flask is based on Werkzeug a WSGI utility library and Jinja2 which is its template engine. You can use this web application framework to compile modules and libraries which will also help the developer to write web applications without writing low-level code like thread management and protocols.
